## Why Pricing Feels So Hard

Most sales professionals underprice. Not because they lack confidence — but because they anchor to cost instead of value. The moment you set your price based on what it *cost* you to deliver, you've already lost the framing battle.

Pricing is a communication tool. It tells your prospect what to expect, how to categorize you, and whether you're worth their attention. Get it right, and everything downstream — from close rates to retention — improves.

## The Anchoring Effect

The first number your prospect sees becomes their reference point for everything that follows. This is **anchoring** — one of the most powerful cognitive biases in sales.

How to use it:

- **Lead with your premium option.** When you present a $15,000 package before a $5,000 one, the $5,000 feels reasonable. Reverse the order and it feels expensive.
- **Reference industry benchmarks.** "Companies in your space typically invest $50-80K in this. Our approach delivers comparable results at $25K."
- **Never open with your lowest price.** It becomes the ceiling, not the floor.

> "People don't evaluate price in a vacuum. They evaluate it relative to the nearest reference point you give them."

## The Power of Three

The rule of three isn't just for storytelling — it's essential in pricing. Offer three tiers:

1. **Basic** — The entry point. It should solve the core problem but leave room for desire.
2. **Professional** — Your target option. This is where you want 70% of customers to land.
3. **Premium** — The aspirational choice. Even if few buy it, it makes Professional look like a smart deal.

This structure leverages the **compromise effect**: when faced with three options, people gravitate toward the middle. Design your tiers so the middle option is your most profitable.

## Framing: Cost vs. Investment

The language you use around pricing shapes perception. Compare these:

**Cost framing:** "This will cost you $2,000 per month."

**Investment framing:** "For $2,000 per month, you're generating an average of $14,000 in new revenue."

Same price. Completely different emotional response. Always connect price to *outcome*, not expense.

### Daily Equivalence

Another powerful framing technique: break the price down to its daily equivalent.

"That's less than $66 per day — about what you'd spend on two team lunches."

When you shrink the number and attach it to something trivial, the perceived cost drops dramatically.

## The Decoy Effect

Introduce a strategically inferior option to make your target option shine. Classic example:

- **Online-only subscription:** $59/year
- **Print-only subscription:** $125/year
- **Online + Print bundle:** $125/year

Nobody picks print-only — but its presence makes the bundle look like an incredible deal. The decoy exists solely to redirect choice.

## Handling the "Too Expensive" Objection

When a prospect says your price is too high, they're rarely talking about the number itself. They're saying one of three things:

1. **"I don't understand the value yet."** → You haven't connected price to outcome. Go back to discovery.
2. **"I'm comparing you to something cheaper."** → Find out what they're comparing to and reframe the differences.
3. **"I don't have the budget."** → This is a timing issue, not a pricing issue. Explore payment structures or phased approaches.

Never respond to "too expensive" by lowering your price. That confirms they were right to push back and erodes your positioning.

## Price Confidence Is Contagious

Your prospect reads your energy. If you flinch when you say the number, they'll sense weakness. If you state it with calm certainty, they'll trust it.

Practice saying your price out loud. Remove qualifiers like "it's only" or "we could maybe do." State the number. Pause. Let them process.

The most powerful thing you can do after saying a price is nothing. Silence is your ally.

## Building Your Pricing Playbook

1. **Anchor high** before revealing your actual price.
2. **Offer three tiers** with the middle as your target.
3. **Frame as investment**, not cost — always tie to outcomes.
4. **Use daily equivalence** to shrink perceived cost.
5. **Handle objections** by diagnosing the real concern, not discounting.
6. **Deliver the price with confidence** and let silence do the selling.

Pricing isn't about finding the "right" number. It's about creating the right context for any number to feel justified. Master the psychology, and you'll never underprice again.
